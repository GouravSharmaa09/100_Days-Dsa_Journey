# 🚀 DSA Journey (Python)

Welcome to my DSA repository! I am documenting my daily progress, logic building, and problem-solving journey. Currently focusing on **Arrays, Matrix, and Searching Algorithms.**

## 📈 Progress Overview
- **Current Status:** Day 21 / 100
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Goal:** Master Data Structures & Algorithms to crack top-tier product companies.

## 📅 Recent Milestones
### Day 23: Solved Search Insert Position
- Understood that it's essentially a Lower Bound problem . Optimized searching from $O(N)$ to $O(\log N)$.

### 🔍 Day 21: Binary Search Deep Dive
- Implemented **Iterative Binary Search** ($O(1)$ space complexity).
- Implemented **Recursive Binary Search** (Understanding the call stack and base cases).
- Mastered the concept of "Divide and Conquer" in sorted search spaces.

### 🔢 Day 20: 4-Sum (The Final Boss of Two-Pointers)
- Solved the **4-Sum Problem** (LeetCode #18).
- Reduced complexity from $O(N^4)$ brute force to **$O(N^3)$ Optimal** using the Two-Pointer technique.
- Handled complex duplicate skipping to ensure unique quadruplets.

### 🧩 Earlier Highlights
- **Matrix Mastery:** Set Matrix Zeroes, Spiral Matrix, and Rotate Image.
- **Two Pointers:** 2-Sum, 3-Sum (Optimal), and Container With Most Water.
- **Array Fundamentals:** Kadane’s Algorithm, Dutch National Flag, and Pascles Triangle.
