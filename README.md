## 📅 Recent Milestones

### 🔄 Day 32 - 35: Recursion & Backtracking (The Brain-Bender)
- **Day 35:** Mastered **Recursion Patterns**: 
    - **Counting Subsequences** (Return `1` or `0` logic).
    - **Boolean Recursion** (Exist or Not - Short-circuiting technique).
    - **Constraint Generation**: Binary strings with no consecutive 1s (Lexicographical order).
- **Day 34:** Deep dive into **Subsets & Subsequences** (LeetCode #78 & #90). Mastered the **Pick and Non-Pick** (Include/Exclude) strategy and handled duplicates using sorting.
- **Day 33:** Solved **Single Number** (LeetCode #136) and **Power Set** using both Bitmasking and Recursion.
- **Day 32:** Bit Manipulation Basics: Decimal to Binary, XOR Swap, and checking K-th bit (Left/Right Shift).

### ⚡ Day 30 - 31: Bit Manipulation Mastery
- **Optimal Patterns:** Solved **Minimum Bit Flips** (start to goal) and **Power of 2** check using the $O(1)$ trick: `n & (n-1) == 0`.
- **Set Bit Magic:** Implemented **Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm** to count set bits in $O(\text{set bits})$ time.

### 🔗 Day 26 - 29: Singly Linked List (The Core)
- **Day 29:** Mastered **Odd-Even Indexing** (LC #328) and **Remove Nth Node From End** (LC #19) using Fast & Slow pointers.
- **Day 28:** Cycle Detection & Length of Loop (LC #141 & #142).
