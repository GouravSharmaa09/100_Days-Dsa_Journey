# 🚀 100 Days of DSA Mastery (Python)

Welcome to my DSA repository! I am documenting my daily progress, logic building, and problem-solving journey. Currently, I have transitioned from Arrays to the world of **Linked Lists**.

## 📈 Progress Overview
- **Current Status:** Day 29 / 100 
- **Current Topic:** Linked Lists 🔗
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Goal:** Crack top-tier product companies by mastering problem-solving patterns.

## 📅 Recent Milestones

### 🔗 Day 26 - 29: Singly Linked List (The Core)
- **Day 29:** Mastered **Odd-Even Indexing** (LeetCode #328) and **Remove Nth Node From End** (LeetCode #19) using the Two-Pointer (Fast & Slow) technique.
- **Day 28:** Deep dive into **Cycle Detection** (LeetCode #141 & #142). Solved Cycle Detection, Starting Point of Cycle, and Length of Loop.
- **Day 27:** Implemented **Middle of Linked List** (Tortoise & Hare) and **Reverse Linked List** (Optimal $O(1)$ space).
- **Day 26:** Foundation of Linked Lists. Built `Node` and `SinglyLinkedList` classes from scratch with **Append** and **Insert** logic.

### 🔍 Day 21 - 25: Searching & Logic Building
- **Binary Search Masterclass:** Solved Search Insert Position (Lower Bound), Floor/Ceiling, and Peak Element.
- **Binary Search Deep Dive:** Implemented both **Iterative** and **Recursive** approaches ($O(\log N)$).

### 🔢 Day 20: 4-Sum (The Final Boss of Two-Pointers)
- Reduced complexity from $O(N^4)$ to **$O(N^3)$ Optimal** using the Two-Pointer technique.
- Handled complex duplicate skipping for unique quadruplets.
